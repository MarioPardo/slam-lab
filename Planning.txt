Phase 1: Data and Constraints []
 * this is where we create the pose graphs


 [X]Watch Cyrill Stachniss "Graph Based SLAM using Pose Graphs" lecture

    Deliverable:
    "Spaghetti Plot" where we plot incomding oometry poses. 


[X] Phase 2: Occupancy Grid  

    Deliverable: 
    Point Cloud Overlay showing mulitple scans working together

[X] Phase 3: Scan Matching

    [X] Study ICP
    Deliverable:
    []Transform function : take in 2 points, output transformation between em
    [X]Scan Matcher

Phase 3: Pose Graph

    [x] Keyframe logic
    [x] Graph data structure
    [x] visualize the graph

    
    Deliverable: Store pose graph + display it on visualization tool

TODO NEXT: Use keyframes we are storing for ICP
        instead of scan to scan, we want scan to keyframe
        possibly change our distance thresholds.
    
Phase 4: Loop Closure
