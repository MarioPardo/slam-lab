Phase 1: Data and Constraints []
 * this is where we create the pose graphs


 [X]Watch Cyrill Stachniss "Graph Based SLAM using Pose Graphs" lecture

    Deliverable:
    "Spaghetti Plot" where we plot incomding oometry poses. 


[X] Phase 2: Occupancy Grid  

    Deliverable: 
    Point Cloud Overlay showing mulitple scans working together

[X] Phase 3: Scan Matching

    [] Study ICP
    Deliverable:
    []Transform function : take in 2 points, output transformation between em
    []Scan Matcher

Phase 3: Back End Optimization

    
Phase 4: Loop Closure
